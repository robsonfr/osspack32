Sometime I came across interesting OSS and try to practice what linux users would do (mostly), build executables from sources. This is the result.

These builds focused on small size and whenever possible are in static build (because there is no package manager that solve dlls hell in windows world).

Note that the information about each build itself remained in my blog. So it maybe confusing for someone who get here directly. Sorry for the inconvenience.
